Stomp
The creature stomps one of its feet at a point on the ground within 10 feet of it. Any creature in a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder centered on this point must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (3d10) bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Until the creature uses its Stomp again or moves, the target is restrained. While restrained in this way, the target (or another creature within 5 feet of it) can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the target relocates to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the creature and is no longer restrained.
Structures, as well as nonmagical objects that are neither being worn nor carried, take the same amount of damage if they are in the cylinder (no save).

If the creature takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed foe, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the foe, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the creature. If the creature dies, a swallowed foe is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.
