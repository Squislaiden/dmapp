Absorb Attack
When an enemy the creature can see hits it with a melee weapon attack, the weapon snags on a pocket of residual dimensional energy and is caught fast. The attack is negated and the weapon cannot be used until the enemy succeeds on a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to pull it out of the creature. Natural weapons can have their attacks negated by this feature, but can then be retracted automatically at the end of the attacking creature’s turn.

Dream Eater
When an unconscious target the creature can see within 30 feet of it regains consciousness, the creature can force the target to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the target takes 11 (2d10) psychic damage, and the creature regains hit points equal to the amount of damage taken.

Empathic Feedback
When the creature takes damage from a creature it can see within 60 feet of it, the creature can force that creature to succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or take 9 (2d8) psychic damage.

Feed on Death

Earth Counter (Recharge 5-6)
When an enemy the creature can see within 30 feet of it casts a spell, the creature counters it. This reaction works like the counterspell spell, except the creature can only counter spells that directly affect or create earth or stone, such as stone shape, wall of stone, or move earth, and it doesn’t need to make a spellcasting ability check, regardless of the spell’s level.

Void Body
The creature can reduce the damage it takes from a single source to 0. Radiant damage can only be reduced by half.

Ruff Spikes
When an enemy tries to enter a space adjacent to the creature, the creature flares its many feelers and spikes. The enemy cannot enter a space adjacent to the creature unless it makes a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the enemy can keep moving but only into spaces that aren't within 5 feet of the creature and takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage from spikes.

Void Twist
When the creature is hit by a ranged attack it can create a small rift in space to increase its AC by 3 against that attack.

Use the original attack roll to determine if the attack hits the new target.

Time-Assisted Counterattack
The creature’s awareness of the near future allows it to see attacks before they happen. When an enemy the creature can see attacks it while within 5 feet of it, the creature can attack the enemy before the enemy’s attack hits. The creature makes a single melee attack against the enemy. If the enemy is reduced to 0 hp as a result of the creature’s attack, the enemy’s attack doesn’t hit the creature.

The creature can shift parts of its body to avoid harm. When the creature takes damage, roll a d12. Reduce the damage it takes by the number rolled.

Voracious
The creature's veins glow when a spell is cast within 30 feet of it, countering the spell. This reaction works like the counterspell spell, except the creature must always make a spellcasting ability check, no matter the spell level. Its ability check for this is +5. If it successfully counters the spell, the creature feeds on the spell, regaining hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.

Ride the Bolt
The creature can travel instantly along any bolt of lightning. When it is within 5 feet of a lightning effect, the creature can teleport to any unoccupied space inside or within 5 feet of that lightning effect.

Blood Drain
An enemy that touches the creature or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (2d4) necrotic damage and the creature gains temporary hit points equal to that amount as it drains blood from the victim. Its temporary hp can't exceed half its maximum hp. If the creature takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the creature's next turn, although it retains any temporary hp it previously gained.

Thick Skin
