An enemy creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Shattered Earth
The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the creature can see within 120 feet of it. Any enemy within 20 feet of the point must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and trapped in the ground. An enemy trapped in this way is restrained and can't stand up.

Beast Swarm

The beasts remain until they're killed or until the creature dismisses them as an action. The creature can use this action again, but no more than eight giant beasts can be present at a time.

Becoming Animal
The creature targets an enemy within the lair that it can see. The enemy must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be magically transformed into a CR 1 beast as if by a polymorph spell. At the beginning of its turn, a transformed enemy repeats the saving throw. If it fails, the enemy must use its action to attack one of the creature's foes. If it succeeds, the effect ends and the enemy returns to its normal form. The effect lasts until the enemy succeeds on the saving throw or until the creature uses this lair action again.
