Constrict
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the creature isn't already constricting an enemy, and the target is restrained until this grapple ends.

Eye Rays (Generates 1 with decreasing chances for each additional one) (make varible, to check and not double up rays)
The creature shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 ft. of it:
- Charm Ray. The targeted enemy must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the creature for 1 hour, or until the creature harms the enemy.
- Paralyzing Ray. The targeted enemy must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- Fear Ray. The targeted enemy must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- Slowing Ray. The targeted enemy must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the enemy can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The enemy can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- Enervation Ray. The targeted enemy must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- Telekinetic Ray. If the target is an enemy, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the creature moves it up to 30 ft. in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the creature's next turn or until the creature is incapacitated.
If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 ft. in any direction. The creature can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.
- Sleep Ray. The targeted enemy must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another enemy takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.
- Petrification Ray. The targeted enemy must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the enemy begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the enemy is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.
- Disintegration Ray. If the target is an enemy, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the enemy to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.
If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.
- Death Ray. The targeted enemy must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.

Icy Shortbow
Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) cold damage, and the target must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or gain 2 levels of exhaustion from the arrow's icy chill. If the save succeeds, the target also becomes immune to further exhaustion from the arrows for 24 hours (but any levels of exhaustion already gained remain in effect). A character who gains a sixth level of exhaustion doesn't die automatically but drops to 0 hit points and must make death saving throws as normal. The exhaustion lasts until the target recovers fully from the cold damage.

Disheartening Touch
Melee Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) psychic damage.

Sapping Claw
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (3d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or have its speed halved and have disadvantage on Dexterity-based checks and saving throws for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Hideous Feast
The bloated ghoul feeds on a corpse within 5 feet of it that is less than 1 week old. It regains 1d8 hit points on a Tiny corpse and an additional 1d8 per size category above Tiny.

Spectral Claw
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (4d8 + 3) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 level of exhaustion. A creature can suffer no more than 2 levels of exhaustion from Spectral Claws.

Invisibility
The creature magically turns invisible until it attacks, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the creature wears or carries is invisible with it.

Tusks
Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d6 + 8) slashing damage, and if the target is the same size as the creature or smaller it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

Psychic Stab
The creature targets one enemy that it can sense within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Fissure
The creature opens a fissure in the ground within 120 feet of it that is 60 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 2d4 x 10 feet deep. Each enemy standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse as if the structure was in the area of an earthquake spell. The creature can have only one fissure open at a time. If it opens another, the previous fissure closes, shunting all creatures inside it to the surface.

Acid Touch
As an action, the creature destroys one nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried, such as a rope, plank, candlestick, or even an entire bronze cauldron.

Mind-Weakening Ray
The creature targets one crature within 30 ft. that it can see. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw or take 9 (2d8) psychic damage and be unable to cast spells or activate magic items for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Domination Ray
The creature targets one crature within 30 ft. that it can see. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the creature for 1 minute or until the target takes damage. The creature can issue telepathic commands to the charmed creature (no action required), which it does its best to obey.

Psyche-Reconstruction Ray
The creature targets one crature within 30 ft. that it can see. The target must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw, taking 12 (2d10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it dies and transforms into a spectator under the creature’s control and acts immediately after the creature in the initiative order. The target can’t be returned to its original form by any means short of a wish spell while the creature is alive.
